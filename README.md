## Project Overview
The report provides a broad overview of energy consumption, production, and expenditure data. The purpose of this report is to educate the general public on how our nation's energy consumption, production, and expenditure has changed over time, with an emphasis on renewable vs. nonrenewable energy. We believe that people should be more concerned with the state of the environment and hope that our report will motivate people to consider the importance of renewable energy and our planet's future.

## Data
The dataset we are working with contains data on energy consumption, production, and expenditures from 1960 to 2014. This data was collected by the US Energy Information Administration, a part of the US Department of Energy, and is publicly available here: [State Energy Data System](https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php?sid=US#CompleteDataFile)

## Structure
The first tab contains a simple overview map that shows how energy trends vary between states. The next three tabs contains different visualizations that explores a different aspect of the data - production, consumption, or expenditures. Each visualization allows the data to be considered at either the nationwide level or a per-state level at various points in our nation's history. Above each chart is an overview describing the chart and its features, along with the conclusions that we have come to.
